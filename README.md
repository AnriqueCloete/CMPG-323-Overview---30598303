# CMPG-323-Overview---30598303
Overview of the module CMPG 323 and all projects and how i plan on tackling these projects
Each of my projects will have its own repository, thus 5 repositories in total, and all repositories will be linked back to the overview repository created in Project 1
I plan on using the same branching strategy for all my projects, I will be working directly on the main branch.
I will make use of a gitignore file in each project. I will use it to ignore backup files.
I have created my a ceasar cipher that i use to encrypt a text file that contains all my credentials and sensitive information.
Additionally I have this information stored on a usb as well as a printed copy which I keep seperate and a secure locations.

I will now add information about each project and how each project should be used:
